# Vehicle-License-Plate-Recognition-System.
Steps/Requirements:

Data Acquisition:

Creation of a diversified dataset with various vehicle images for model training and validation.
Image Preprocessing:

Application of filtering and restoration techniques to enhance the quality of the images, including contrast adjustments, noise reduction, enhancement, and/or histogram equalization.
Vehicle License Plate Detection:

Development of an algorithm to isolate vehicle license plates within the images, using segmentation and contour techniques.
Character Recognition of License Plates:

Extract the characters from the cropped license plate. Use connected object detection and morphological techniques to improve the quality of the characters if necessary.
Implementation of an optical character recognition (OCR) system to extract information from the detected plates (Use the Tesseract OCR library in Python, or any other preferred method).
